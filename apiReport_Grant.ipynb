    "The hypothesis I will be testing is that albums released during the summer months experience a higher average number of streams compared to tracks released in other seasons. My theoretical application of this hypothesis would be that people are typically out doing more activities during the summer. People are out of school and have a lot more free time. Additionally, pleasant weather can lead to things like parties, where you'd be playing music. The statistical application of my hypothesis would be that artists and labels strategically pick what time of the year they release an album. I theorize that at times labels may want their artist to release an album during an off-season. This would be in effort to have less competition at the time the album releases because other labels may be thinking similarly."

    "The two endpoints I am testing my hypothesis are Drake's album \"Her Loss\" and Kendrick Lamar's \"Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers\". I am chosing these two to test my hypothesis because both albums released in 2022. \"Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers\" released on May 13th, 2022, and \"Her Loss\" released on November 4th, 2022. I also chose these two artists because they are from the same genre and they have been rather equal in popularity for years. This should strengthen my hypothesis to make it more reliable. It could be unreliable because of bias. Some people viewing the data may prefer one artist over an other or view their success a different way. I do not believe there will be any limitations testing this hypothesis."

I was having issues using iloc and trying to get the specific artists names with the track titles. This would have been relevant if there was a feature on any of the tracks because that could have added to a songs streaming success. Another issue I have is that just viewing the two charts I created alone is not enough to determine what season would be better to release an album. I feel I needed more information the Spotify API itself could not provide."

Despite how I feel about it, my hypothesis is somewhat supported by the data I did find. Kendrick's album is more popular than Drake's, but this only supports my hypothesis somewhat because of a few reasons. Kendrick's album has been out longer than Drake's, with Kendrick's album releasing in May of 2022 and Drake's releasing that November. There has been more time for people to be able to stream Kendrick's music. Additionally, there was a \"beef\" between Kendrick and Drake earlier this year. Kendrick seemingly won the feud, so his streaming numbers are likely inflated because of that recent victory. My hypothesis is supported by the data I collected from the Spotify API, with some discrepancies."
